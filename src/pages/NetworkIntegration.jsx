          <p>
            An active network contains at least one voltage source or current source that can supply energy to the network indefinitely. A passive network does not contain an active source. Active elements can inject power to the circuit, provide power gain, and control the current flow within the circuit. A passive network is a type of computer network in which each node works on a predefined function or process. Passive networks don't execute any specialized code or instruction at any node and don't change their behaviour dynamically. Typically, this behaviour is related to each network router node.
